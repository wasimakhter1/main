# **App Name**: ImageForge

## Core Features:

- Photo Resize: Resize images to specific dimensions, offering scaling options while preserving aspect ratio.
- Format Conversion: Convert images between various formats such as JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF.
- Compression: Reduce image file size while maintaining acceptable image quality, using AI to select the best compression parameters.
- Bulk Resizing: Apply resizing and format conversion to multiple images simultaneously.
- DPI Control: Change the DPI (dots per inch) of an image for printing purposes. Let AI decide whether it will make use of scaling tools or suggest editing changes.
- Preset Dimensions: Provide a list of preset dimensions for common use cases like social media, banners, or profile pictures.
- AI Image Enhancement: Suggest related images based on a source image, powered by generative AI to enhance design projects.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to convey a sense of creativity and professionalism.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), almost white, for a clean, modern look.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) used sparingly for key interactive elements to draw the user's eye and create contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will provide a modern and neutral aesthetic for both headlines and body text.
- Use a consistent set of icons that represent each image processing function (resize, convert, compress, etc.).
- Keep the layout clean and intuitive with a clear visual hierarchy that allows users to easily navigate image processing tasks.
- Subtle animations and transitions can be used to provide feedback to user interactions and enhance user experience.
